## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher.
-   **Maven**: For managing dependencies and building the project.
-   **Gemini API Key**: You need an API key from Google AI Studio to use the "Ask AI" feature.
    -   Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/fahim07ms/Lume
    cd Lume
    ```

2.  **Set up the Gemini API Key:**
    The application looks for your API key in an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

    -   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```sh
        setx GEMINI_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        (You may need to restart your terminal or IDE for this to take effect.)

    -   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```sh
        export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        (To make this permanent, add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file.)

3.  **Build and Run with Maven:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run the following command:
    ```sh
    ./mvnw clean javafx:run
    ```
    Maven will download the necessary dependencies and launch the application.
